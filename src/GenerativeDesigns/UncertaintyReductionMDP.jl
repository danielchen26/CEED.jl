    UncertaintyReductionMDP(costs; sampler, uncertainty, threshold, evidence=Evidence(), <keyword arguments>)

Structure that parametrizes the experimental decision-making process. It is used in the object interface of POMDPs.

In this experimental setup, our objective is to minimize the expected experimental cost while ensuring the uncertainty remains below a specified threshold.

Internally, a state of the decision process is modeled as a tuple `(evidence::Evidence, [total accumulated monetary cost, total accumulated execution time])`.

# Arguments

  - `costs`: a dictionary containing pairs `experiment => cost`, where `cost` can either be a scalar cost (modelled as a monetary cost) or a tuple `(monetary cost, execution time)`.

# Keyword Arguments

  - `sampler`: a function of `(evidence, features, rng)`, in which `evidence` denotes the current experimental evidence, `features` represent the set of features we want to sample from, and `rng` is a random number generator; it returns a dictionary mapping the features to outcomes.
  - `uncertainty`: a function of `evidence`; it returns the measure of variance or uncertainty about the target variable, conditioned on the experimental evidence acquired so far.
  - `threshold`: a number representing the acceptable level of uncertainty about the target variable.
  - `evidence=Evidence()`: initial experimental evidence.
  - `costs_tradeoff`: tradeoff between monetary cost and execution time of an experimental designs, given as a tuple of floats.
  - `max_parallel`: maximum number of parallel experiments.
  - `discount`: this is the discounting factor utilized in reward computation.
  - `bigM`: it refers to the penalty that arises in a scenario where further experimental action is not an option, yet the uncertainty exceeds the allowable limit.
  - `max_experiments`: this denotes the maximum number of experiments that are permissible to be conducted.
