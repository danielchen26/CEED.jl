# # Heart Disease Triage

# Consider a situation where a group of patients is tested for a specific disease. It may be costly to conduct an experiment yielding the definitive answer. Instead, we want to utilize various proxy experiments that provide partial information about the presence of the disease.
# For details on the theoretical background and notation, please see our tutorial on [static experimental designs](SimpleStatic.md), this tutorial
# is a concrete application of the tools described in that document.

# ### Application to Predictive Modeling 

# Let's generalize the example from [static experimental designs](SimpleStatic.md) to the case where we want to compute the information value $v_{S}$ as the predictive
# ability of a machine learning model which uses the measurements gained from experiments in $S$ to predict some $y$ of interest.
# 
# Let's introduce some formal notation.
# Consider a dataset of historical readouts over $m$ features $X = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$, and let $y$ denote the target variable that we want to predict.
# Assume that each experiment $e \in E$ yields readouts over a subset $X_e \subseteq X$ of features.

# Then, for each subset $S \subseteq E$ of experiments, we may model the value of information acquired by conducting the experiments in $S$ as the accuracy of a predictive model that predicts the value of $y$ based on readouts over features in $X_S = \bigcup_{e\in S} X_e$.
# Then this accuracy is our information value $v_{S}$ of $S$.

# ## Heart Disease Dataset

# In this tutorial, we consider a dataset that includes 11 clinical features along with a binary variable indicating the presence of heart disease in patients. The dataset can be found at [Kaggle: Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction). It utilizes heart disease datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

using CSV, DataFrames
data = CSV.File("data/heart_disease.csv") |> DataFrame
data[1:10, :]

# ## Predictive Accuracy

# The CEEDesigns.jl package offers an additional flexibility by allowing an experiment to yield readouts over multiple features at the same time. In our scenario, we can consider the features `RestingECG`, `Oldpeak`, `ST_Slope`, and `MaxHR` to be obtained from a single experiment `ECG`.

# We specify the experiments along with the associated features:

experiments = Dict(
    ## experiment => features
    "BloodPressure" => ["RestingBP"],
    "ECG" => ["RestingECG", "Oldpeak", "ST_Slope", "MaxHR"],
    "BloodCholesterol" => ["Cholesterol"],
    "BloodSugar" => ["FastingBS"],
)

# We may also provide additional zero-cost features, which are always available.
zero_cost_features = ["Age", "Sex", "ChestPainType", "ExerciseAngina"]

# And we specify the target for prediction.
target = "HeartDisease"

# ### Classifier

# We use [MLJ.jl](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/) to evaluate the predictive accuracy over subsets of experimental features.

using MLJ
import BetaML, MLJModels
using Random: seed!

# We provide appropriate scientific types of the features.

types = Dict(
    :ChestPainType => Multiclass,
    :Oldpeak => Continuous,
    :HeartDisease => Multiclass,
    :Age => Continuous,
    :ST_Slope => Multiclass,
    :RestingECG => Multiclass,
    :RestingBP => Continuous,
    :Sex => Multiclass,
    :FastingBS => Continuous,
    :ExerciseAngina => Multiclass,
)
data = coerce(data, types);

# Next, we choose a particular predictive model that will evaluated in the sequel. We can list all models that are compatible with our dataset:

models(matching(data, data[:, "HeartDisease"]))

# Eventually, we fix `RandomForestClassifier` from [BetaML](https://github.com/sylvaticus/BetaML.jl)
classifier = @load RandomForestClassifier pkg = BetaML verbosity = 3
model = classifier(; n_trees = 20, max_depth = 10)

# ### Performance Evaluation

# We use `evaluate_experiments` from `CEEDesigns.StaticDesigns` to evaluate the predictive accuracy over subsets of experiments. We use `LogLoss` as a measure of accuracy. It is possible to provide additional keyword arguments, which will be passed to `MLJ.evaluate` (such as `measure`, shown below).

using CEEDesigns, CEEDesigns.StaticDesigns

#

seed!(1) # evaluation process generally is not deterministic
perf_eval = evaluate_experiments(
    experiments,
    model,
    data[!, Not("HeartDisease")],
    data[!, "HeartDisease"];
    zero_cost_features,
    measure = LogLoss(),
)

# We plot performance measures evaluated for subsets of experiments, sorted by performance measure.
plot_evals(
    perf_eval;
    f = x -> sort(collect(keys(x)); by = k -> x[k], rev = true),
    ylabel = "logloss",
)

# ## Cost-Efficient Designs

# We specify the cost associated with the execution of each experiment.

costs = Dict(
    ## experiment => cost
    "BloodPressure" => 1,
    "ECG" => 5,
    "BloodCholesterol" => 20,
    "BloodSugar" => 20,
)

# We use the provided function `efficient_designs` to construct the set of cost-efficient experimental designs.
designs = efficient_designs(costs, perf_eval)
#
plot_front(designs; labels = make_labels(designs), ylabel = "logloss")

# ### Parallel Experiments

# The previous example assumed that experiments had to be run sequentially. We can see how the optimal arrangement changes if we assume multiple experiments can be run in parallel. To that end, we first specify the monetary cost and execution time for each experiment, respectively.

experiments_costs = Dict(
    ## experiment => (monetary cost, execution time) => features
    "BloodPressure" => (1.0, 1.0) => ["RestingBP"],
    "ECG" => (5.0, 5.0) => ["RestingECG", "Oldpeak", "ST_Slope", "MaxHR"],
    "BloodCholesterol" => (20.0, 20.0) => ["Cholesterol"],
    "BloodSugar" => (20.0, 20.0) => ["FastingBS"],
)

# We set the maximum number of concurrent experiments. Additionally, we can specify the tradeoff between monetary cost and execution time. In our case, we aim to minimize the execution time.

# Below, we demonstrate the flexibility of `efficient_designs` as it can both evaluate the performance of experiments and generate efficient designs. Internally, `evaluate_experiments` is called first, followed by `efficient_designs`. Keyword arguments to the respective functions has to wrapped in `eval_options` and `arrangement_options` named tuples, respectively.

## Implicit, calculates accuracies automatically.
seed!(1) # evaluation process generally is not deterministic
designs = efficient_designs(
    experiments_costs,
    model,
    data[!, Not("HeartDisease")],
    data[!, "HeartDisease"];
    eval_options = (; zero_cost_features, measure = LogLoss()),
    arrangement_options = (; max_parallel = 2, tradeoff = (0.0, 1)),
)

# As we can see, the algorithm correctly suggests running experiments in parallel.
plot_front(designs; labels = make_labels(designs), ylabel = "logloss")
